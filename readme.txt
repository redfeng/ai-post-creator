Provides a REST API endpoint to create Gutenberg posts from AI-generated Markdown content.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a simple but powerful tool to publish content from AI models or other Markdown-based sources directly into WordPress. It creates a custom REST API endpoint that accepts a title and Markdown content, converts the Markdown to proper Gutenberg blocks on the server, and creates a new post.

This is the most robust way to programmatically import content, ensuring perfect compatibility with the block editor.

It's perfect for:

*   Publishing content generated by AI models (like GPT, Gemini, etc.).
*   Automating your content marketing pipeline.
*   Integrating with headless CMS setups or external writing tools.

== Installation ==

1.  **Download Parsedown**: This plugin requires the `Parsedown.php` library. Download it from [https://parsedown.org/](https://parsedown.org/) (click the "Download" button for the single file).
2.  Place the `Parsedown.php` file inside this plugin's directory (`/wp-content/plugins/ai-post-creator/`).
3.  Upload the entire `ai-post-creator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress site.
4.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Usage ==

To create a post, send a `POST` request to the following REST API endpoint:

`https://your-domain.com/wp-json/ai-creator/v1/create-post`

You must be authenticated with the WordPress REST API (e.g., using Application Passwords) and have the `publish_posts` capability.

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "title": "Your Awesome Post Title",
  "markdown_content": "## A Heading\n\nThis is a paragraph with **bold** text and a [link](https://wordpress.org).\n\n- List item 1\n- List item 2",
  "status": "publish"
}
```

*   `title` (string, required): The title of the post.
*   `markdown_content` (string, required): The full Markdown content.
*   `status` (string, optional): The post status. Can be `publish`, `draft`, or `pending`. Defaults to `draft`.

**Success Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "post_id": 123,
    "post_url": "https://your-domain.com/your-awesome-post-title/",
    "message": "Post created successfully."
}
