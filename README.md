A simple but powerful WordPress plugin that provides a REST API endpoint to create Gutenberg posts from AI-generated (or any) Markdown content.

This plugin is the perfect bridge between modern content workflows and WordPress, ensuring programmatically created posts are perfectly compatible with the Gutenberg block editor.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Markdown to Gutenberg**: Converts standard Markdown into a clean Gutenberg block structure.
- **Custom REST API Endpoint**: Provides a dedicated, easy-to-use API endpoint for content creation.
- **AI-Ready**: Designed specifically for content generated by AI models like Gemini, GPT, etc.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Secure and easy to integrate into any application or workflow.
- **Lightweight**: No bloat, just one core function done well.

## üöÄ Why Use This Plugin?

Manually copying and pasting AI-generated content into WordPress is slow and error-prone. This plugin automates the process, allowing you to:

- **Automate Content Pipelines**: Directly publish from your scripts or applications.
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Avoids HTML formatting issues by using WordPress's native block conversion functions.
- **Integrate with Headless Setups**: Use WordPress as a backend and feed it content from anywhere.

    -   Click the "Download" button to get the single `Parsedown.php` file.

2.  **Add `Parsedown.php` to the Plugin**:
